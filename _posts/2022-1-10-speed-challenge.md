The goal of this small project was to predict speed of the car from video stream
and also learn how to write Tensorflow workflow.

This post describes my thought process for predicting speed of a driving 
car from video stream. The solution provided was to [Comma.ai speed challenge](https://github.com/commaai/speedchallenge). 
Provided dataset is one **train.mp4** video with color stream and **train.txt** text file
with speed of the car for corresponding frame from video. 




Below is sample frame provided in dataset for the challenge.
