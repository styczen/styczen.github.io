Hello,
I'm Bartek and I'm a software engineer currently working in R&D 
robotics project in Gdansk, Poland. My daily responsibilities consist of computer 
vision system processing. I'm working mainly in C++, Python using
OpenCV, Open3D and PCL libraries. 

On this website, I'm describing some of my personal projects and things that
I've learned during my work.
